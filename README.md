This is a simple and free Wordpress article parser.

To work parser, you must first specify a path to a page with a list of articles that you need to mate.

Next, in format XPath you need to specify the way to the reference to the article on the source page, so you will indicate what links the plugin should be packed.

In the format, but already on the article page you should indicate the title of the article and the bodies of the article.

In some checkboxes, you can turn on the loading of images into the body of the article, the reunion of the body of the article from references, scripts and clear tags from classes and aid.

Separately, you have the opportunity to indicate to what category the posts of your site should be attached to new information and make sure that the positions created are initially in the draft section.
